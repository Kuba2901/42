## Introduction

Hello! I'm Jakub Nenczak, a student at 42roma. This repository is a collection of my projects and assignments completed as part of the 42 curriculum. Each project showcases my skills and knowledge in various areas of software development, including C programming, system administration, algorithms, and more.

## Projects

### Libft

Libft is the first project at 42, where we build our own C library. This project helps solidify our understanding of standard C functions by reimplementing them.

### Get_Next_Line

The Get_Next_Line project is about reading a line from a file descriptor. This project teaches us how to handle static variables and manage memory efficiently.

### Ft_printf

Ft_printf involves recreating the printf function in C. This project is crucial for understanding variadic functions and improving our skills in formatting and handling different data types.

### Born2beroot

Born2beroot is a system administration project. It involves setting up a virtual machine with specific security and configuration requirements, giving us hands-on experience with system management.

### So_Long

So_Long is a small 2D game project using the MiniLibX graphics library. This project helps us understand game loop mechanics, event handling, and basic graphics programming.

### Push_Swap

Minishell is a simple Unix shell implementation. This project deepens our knowledge of process creation, signal handling, and command execution in a Unix-like environment.
